# Python Scrabble AI

This project aims to create a Scrabble game in Python with various AI opponents. Players can test their skills against AIs using different strategies, such as greedy algorithms, Minimax algorithms with game tree search, and reinforcement learning. The project will also analyze AI performance to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
